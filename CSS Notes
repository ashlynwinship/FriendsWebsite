CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style HTML text

Inline Styles of CSS Within HTML
It's possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles. To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element.
ex. <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial;">I'm learning to code!</p>

The <style> Tag
Inline styles are a fast way of styling HTML, but they also have limitations. If you wanted to style, for example, multiple <h1> elements, you would have to add inline styling to each element manually. In addition, you would also have to maintain the HTML code when additional <h1> elements are added. HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element. CSS can be written between opening and closing <style> tags. To use the <style> element, it must be placed inside of the <head> element.
ex.
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
  </style>
</head>
The CSS code in the example above changes the color of all paragraph text to red and also changes the size of the text to 20 pixels. Note how the syntax of the CSS code matches (for the most part) the syntax you used for inline styling. The main difference is that you can specify which elements to apply the styling to.
